# SCATTERBOX

--- 

This plugin attempts to make level design easier, making it easy to place objects/props such as 
trees, rocks, etc on terrain easily. 
It also allows you to make the props have a random rotation and scale, as well as selecting a
random prop for a pool of props.

Do note that the scatterMesh node requires adding a material to each mesh, and does not
support multiple materials per mesh. It also requires pressing the refresh button upon changing 
the mesh settings.

# How to install?

Copy the contents of the addon folder into your own project's addon folder.
(Or download it from the asset library if I have put it on there)
